# LENS CATALOG — what each lens answers, in plain English

**The read-first reference for the Wayward China-commission money system.** If you want a number —
for an invoice, a report, Metabase, a partner, or Wayward — start here. Current as of the head
migration **`cip_113_refund_netting`** (money engine = cip_104–113; cip_110 dropped the frozen
`ps_monthly_earnings` snapshot — the whole engine reads only live Stripe; cip_113 made `usage_collected`
**net of succeeded refunds**). Live + self-updating; every
figure recomputes from current data.

## 📌 THE canonical number (updated on each engine change)
**Recovery / still-owed to us by Wayward ≈ $13,713** (china, PS-eligible per product, from the 2025-10-01
anchor, minus what Wayward has paid, **net of refunds**). This is the one figure to quote; it lives in
`lens_ps_claim` (`SELECT round(sum(ps_claim_owed),2) FROM lens_ps_claim WHERE verdict='china'`) — always
prefer the live query over any number written here. History: it grew from ~$12,035 to $13,716.66 when
the live Stripe sync recovered $254k of truncated usage lines (2026-07-17), then −$4.08 to $13,712.58
when refund-netting landed (cip_113 — gross mgmt-fee-owed dropped $33.72, but recovery is floored net
of Wayward's payments so it moved less). Older docs cite $10.4k / $11,099 / $12,035 — all superseded.

## The model in one breath
**China? (yes/no)** is the only gate for whether *we* earn Wayward's management commission. Then it's
**per product**: the pre-PS **rev-share** exclusion list is Connect-only, so those brands' **Boost** is
still ours. Of what we earn, if a **partner** is the lead we pass them a cut. Three separate money
flows: (1) *Wayward → us* (our commission), (2) *us → our partners* (the split), (3) *Wayward → the
exclusion-list partners direct* (Eric et al. — **not ours**, tracked separately).

## The lenses, by the question they answer

### "What does Wayward owe us?" (the invoice)
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_claim** | Per china brand: `mgmt_fee_owed` · `wayward_paid` · **`ps_claim_owed`** (still owed, floored at 0) + partner side. THE invoice source. |
| **lens_ps_commission_ledger** | The detail behind it — per brand × product × month: collected, `mgmt_rate` (10/6/3), `claimable`, `mgmt_fee_owed`, `partner_fee_owed`, `claim_status`. |
| **lens_ps_rate_schedule** | The 10/6/3 ladder dates per brand × product (re-anchored by a qualifying reactivation). |
| **lens_ps_ar_aging** | Of what's owed, **how long unpaid** — `months_outstanding` + `aging_bucket`. |
| **lens_ps_refund_allocation** | Per brand × product × month: the refund netted OUT of collected (`usage_refund_netted`) + the raw pre-cap figure. The transparency surface for the refund-netting — how collected goes gross → net. |
| **lens_ps_monthly_summary** | The trend line: owed / partner-owed / **net** by month × product. |

### "Is each brand set up right?"
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_product_eligibility** | Per china brand × product: `ps_rev_share_eligible` · `wayward_client_fee_rate` (what Wayward charges the client) · `ps_partner_rev_share_eligible` + `partner_name` + `partner_rate_pct`. The setup view. |
| **lens_ps_china_verdict** | The nationality call per brand (china / not_china / unknown) + its evidence strength. Signals now include **`card_country_cn`/`_hk`** (cip_116) — a brand paying predominantly with CN/HK-issued cards, derived from `ps_stripe_charges` each extras sync. One-directional: card_country only ADDS china evidence; a human `manual_review` not_china still wins. |
| **lens_ps_china_contention** (cip_117) | The **contention review queue**: brands whose signals disagree (china evidence AND not_china evidence both present). `review_priority='high'` = a china signal (card_country / partner / slack) overridden by a human/legal not_china on a brand WITH collected revenue ("are we right NOT to claim this?"). Read-only — surfacing never changes a verdict. Separate from the `unknown` "not-sure-yet" queue. |
| **lens_ps_china_companies** | The book, one row per company (not per brand-row) — for headcounts. |
| **lens_ps_exclusion_status** | Is a brand on the contract exclusion list, and is it `takeable`. |
| **lens_ps_brand_header** (cip_126) | One row per brand — the **Brand-360 header**: name, signup, nationality verdict + strength + conflict, excluded status/buckets/takeable, partner + rate. Assembles `ps_brands ⨝ china_verdict ⨝ exclusion_status ⨝ product_eligibility` (1:1, no fan-out — 5,396 rows). |

### "What do we owe our partners?"
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_partner_payout_summary** | Per partner WE pay: owed / paid / **still-owed** / brand count. |
| (detail) `lens_ps_commission_ledger.partner_fee_owed` | The per-brand × product split. |

### "Does Wayward agree / what are they owning?" (reconciliation)
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_wayward_reconciliation** | Per brand: our claim vs **Wayward-credits-Tim** (their attribution) vs paid → `delta_status`. |
| **lens_ps_wayward_stated** | Wayward's OWN stated numbers (total_fees_paid / lifetime commissions / GMV) vs our recorded paid — the cross-check. |
| **lens_ps_statement_drift** | Per brand pinned in `ps_claim_statements`: the **pinned** `stated_claim_owed` vs the **live** `ps_claim_owed` → `drift_amount` (live − stated) + `drift_direction`. **THE FIRST THING CHECKED BEFORE ANY invoice/statement goes out** — flag, don't block. Empty until a claim is pinned. |
| **lens_ps_statements_history** (cip_126) | The sent-statement history — one row per pinned statement × brand (`ps_claim_statements`): `statement_label`, `generated_at`, the pinned mgmt/paid/claim figures + notes. Brand 360 filters by brand; the Statements screen groups by `statement_label`. Empty until a claim is pinned; the WRITE (pinning) is a **FAS-API governed write**, never the reader. |

### "What are the exclusion-list partners driving?" (separate — NOT ours)
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_excluded_partner_performance** | The pre-PS rev-share book (Eric / Heavy Producers / etc., paid **direct by Wayward**): brands + collected revenue per bucket × referrer × product. **Walled off from our owed on purpose** — look here to see what Eric's driving; never subtract it from the claim. |

### "How much revenue did a brand generate?" (DATA ASSET — NOT the money engine)
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_brand_revenue** (cip_114) | Per brand × product × month: **GMV** (product `connect`) / **ad-spend** (`boosted`) = gross billed usage fee ÷ `wayward_client_fee_rate`, computed LIVE. `revenue_amount` NULL + `rate_missing=true` where no client fee rate exists yet (~7.4k of 16.2k rows pending the P3 fee-rate feed). `source` = derived \| wayward_feed \| amazon (a raw feed row in `ps_brand_revenue` overrides the derived value). `basis='gross_billed'` — NOT net of refunds (that's the money engine's `collected`). **Additive: does not feed the commission math.** The reusable revenue asset (reporting stage ① + CRM/other ventures). |

---

### "Can I trust the numbers? / is the data healthy?" (Data Health screen §7.1)
| lens | answers |
|---|---|
| **lens_ps_coverage** (cip_125) | Data-completeness **bands** per dimension: `nationality` ruled (~60%), client `fee_rate` resolved (~54%, **whole-PS** — surfaces the P3-feed gap, not a vanity china-only 100%), `contacts` = china brands with an email/phone/WeChat (~46%). Shape `passed/total/failed/pct/status` (ok≥90 / warn≥50 / else fail). **NOT money** — a completeness signal (fee-rate feeds derived GMV, never the claim). |
| **lens_ps_invariants** (cip_125) | The MATH-SPEC §5 money-engine invariants evaluated **live**: mgmt-fee ≥ 0 · claimable⇒china · rate∈{10/6/3} · partner ≤ mgmt · claim floored at 0 · grain unique. `failed` = violations; `status='fail'` = an **engine finding to investigate, not a lens bug** (currently 9 rows: tiny negative-`usage_collected` cells, −$3 mgmt, claim-floor unaffected). Freshness (3rd Data-Health dimension) reuses `lens_ps_source_freshness`. |

## `delta_status` values (from lens_ps_wayward_reconciliation)
- **`paid_settled`** — Wayward paid, nothing left owed.
- **`paid_partial`** — Wayward paid something, a balance remains.
- **`acknowledged_unpaid`** — Wayward's own CRM credits Tim + marks active, but paid $0 → **the strongest ask**.
- **`credited_other_unpaid`** — we claim it, but Wayward's attribution credits someone else (Eric/Adina), $0 paid (164 brands — the 2nd-biggest bucket; a negotiation conversation, still ours).
- **`unacknowledged_unpaid`** — we claim it, Wayward has no attribution on record, $0 paid.
- **`no_claim`** — nothing owed (not china-eligible, or fully square).
*(An older plan doc lists `we_claim_credit_other` / `we_claim_no_ack` / `not_ours` — those are NOT the shipped names.)*

## Glossary (terms partners/Wayward will hit)
- **usage fee / `usage_collected`** — the base fee the client actually PAID Wayward (Connect = % of GMV, Boost = % of ad spend). `is_ps_base` lines, status=paid, **NET of succeeded refunds** (cip_113). Our commission is a % of this. This is the contract's **"Usage Fees *actually received* by Company"** (§3.1) — a fee that was collected then refunded was not, in the end, received.
- **`usage_refunded` / `lens_ps_refund_allocation`** — the refund netted OUT of `usage_collected`, per brand × product × month. Only **succeeded** refunds, allocated to the `is_ps_base` **share** of their invoice pro-rata (a refund hits the whole invoice incl. non-base commission pass-through — we net only the usage part), minus any amount Wayward already booked as a negative reconciliation line (no double-subtract), capped so collected never goes below 0 from a refund. Credit notes are held as **evidence only** (netting them would double-count against paid amounts / their own refunds). See [REFUND-NETTING-PLAN.md](REFUND-NETTING-PLAN.md).
- **`usage_billed`** — invoiced (paid + open), voids excluded. Billed stays GROSS (a refund doesn't un-bill it). Billed ≥ collected.
- **`wayward_client_fee_rate`** — what WAYWARD charges the CLIENT (5% GMV Connect / ad-spend rate Boost, negotiated 1–6%). NOT our commission.
- **our commission / `mgmt_fee_owed`** — what Wayward owes US: `usage_collected × mgmt_rate`, where `mgmt_rate` is the **10/6/3 ladder** (10% first 12mo, 6% next 6mo, 3% after).
- **`ps_claim_owed`** — `mgmt_fee_owed − wayward_paid`, floored at 0 per brand. The still-owed / invoice number.
- **partner cut / `partner_fee_owed`** — what WE pass a referral partner (default 5% of the usage fee), carved from our commission.
- **`ours_revenue_from`** — the date we start counting a brand's revenue (2025-10-01 never-listed, 2025-12-01 flat-fee, 2025-10-01 rev-share Boost).
- **`flat_fee_era_eric` / `excluded`** — disposition on the contract list: flat-fee = **ours** (Wayward pays us); excluded (rev-share) = **not ours on Connect**, Boost still ours.
- **`unknown_nationality`** — brand not yet ruled china; queued, claimed at $0, revisitable — never denied.
- **`drift_amount`** — live `ps_claim_owed` − the last **pinned** statement figure for a brand (`lens_ps_statement_drift`); `drift_direction` = up/down/none. A pinned statement is the bank statement, `lens_ps_claim` is the live balance — this is the gap between them. Checked before any statement goes out (flags a brand whose live number moved since we handed Wayward its statement); never blocks the send.
